Fixes in development:
---
- Fix bug where you load /, then /scoreboard, then hit back, then click on a marker, and get an abbreviated window

Features in development:
---
- Decouple authorization and callback from a direct Foursquare API call (basically, keep a small batch of requests at the ready)

- Revamp storage of statistics, it's not going to be very workable long term, but would be best done after GA user signup is in place

- Add "-12 hours" privacy support

- Add heat maps
	- "Places I've been overall"
	- "Places everyone has been overall"

- Make a BETTER scoreboard page

Possible features:
---
- Add Gowalla support
- Add Twitter places support
- Add Flickr geotagged photos support
- Add "tweet my history" button
- Add ability for a user to privately visualize their history
