Map256 Google App Engine code
---
Map256 is a basic web application to plot travel path and visualize history of Foursquare/Twitter/Flickr/etc geodata.  All items needed (except for OAuth consumer keys / secrets) are contained in this repository.  The LICENSE file indicates what this is distributed under (basically MIT-style "you're on your own").

Disclaimer for anyone questioning my sanity and fitness to live after reading through this code:  I have never written anything in Python, Javascript, or using Google App Engine before, so if something doesn't follow normal conventions (*cough*spaces vs tabs*cough*) or seems completely misguided, it's more likely due to ignorance or expedience than an unwillingness to do the Right Thing (tm).  Hate mail and coding suggestions can be directed to service@map256.com

Recipe to recreate:

1) Checkout a copy of this repo
2) Create a Google App Engine account & target application (http://appengine.google.com)
3) Gather all of the appropriate application keys (indicated below)
4) Deploy this code to GAE

To get all the keys you need, create a file, "m256_cfg.py" in the top level directory, and place the correct keys in each var:

# http://dev.twitter.com
twitter_consumer_key = 'xxx'
twitter_consumer_secret = 'xxx'

# http://foursquare.com/oauth
foursquare_consumer_key = 'xxx'
foursquare_consumer_secret = 'xxx'

# http://www.flickr.com/services/api/
flickr_api_key = 'xxx'
flickr_api_secret = 'xxx'
flickr_api_sig = 'xxx'

# http://gowalla.com/api/keys
gowalla_api_key = 'xxx'
gowalla_api_secret = 'xxx'
