		<h1><a href="/">map256</a>: FAQ</h1>

		<p><strong>Q: What is map256?</strong></p>
		<p>A: map256 is a tool for someone to show where they have been.  map256 gathers information from <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, and other services to figure this out, and then provides a variety of ways to visualize your travels, showing timelines, (and soon) heatmaps and more.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: How do I make my checkins/tweets/etc show up on map256?</strong></p>
		<p>A: You can head over to your <a href="/profile">profile</a> page, and authorize map256 to access data from the services you want to see mapped.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: Why do I have to sign in to my Google Account to use Map256?</strong></p>
		<p>A: In order to ensure you can have control in the future of your data, map256 requires a login to make sure you are who you say you are.  map256 uses Google Accounts so that you don't have to remember "yet another password".</p>

		<p><strong>Q: I just checked in/tweeted, why hasn't it shown up on my map yet?</strong></p>
		<p>A: map256 looks at checkins every 5 minutes, to avoid overloading our data providers.  Wait a couple of minutes, and try again.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: Why is the map not accurate?  I didn't do anything where it's showing I did!</strong></p>
		<p>A: map256 uses the information provided by Foursquare, Twitter, and others to plot locations.  That information isn't always 100% correct, due to a variety of issues (incorrect street address, out-of-date GPS location, etc).  At this time I can't think of a great way to correct this information.  Got a suggestion on how to make it better?  Send it to <a href="mailto:service@map256.com">service@map256.com</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: What about my privacy?</strong></p>
		<p>A: For the moment, map256 should only be used if you're OK with your location history being available to the world.  On your <a href="">profile</a> page, you can choose to hide the most recent 24 hours worth of information.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: Are you going to "tweet" anything or otherwise bug my friends without my permission?</strong></p>
		<p>A: Currently, no, map256 is a "read only" app.  In the future I might add the ability for people to configure announcement-style things, but I will set that to be "opt-in" for anyone that hasn't previously configured it.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: I've signed up, but now I want to get rid of my history, what do I do?</strong></p>
		<p>A: Sign in to your <a href="/profile">profile</a> page, and you can delete any given service or account.  Note: Deletions are immediate, but some aggregate statistics may take several hours to be removed.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: I don't remember what Google Account I used when I signed up, and I really want to get rid of my history, what do I do?</strong></p>
		<p>A: Send a quick email to <a href="mailto:service@map256.com">service@map256.com</a> with either your Twitter username or Foursquare ID# (or the map256 link to your profile), and I'll remove you from map256 as soon as possible.  (You should probably also remove map256's authorization over at Foursquare/Twitter/etc.)</p>

		<p><strong>Q: What's with the "www" on your domain?  Haven't you heard of <a href="http://no-www.org/">no-www</a>?</strong></p>
		<p>A: I agree that a www subdomain is excessively annoying (and Google's URL redirection doubly so), but until naked domains are <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#naked_domain">officially supported under Google App Engine</a> (which I suspect will be a while), I'm stuck with the "www".</p>

		<p><strong>Q: When are statistics calculated?</strong></p>
		<p>A: Statistics are calculated once an hour, every hour.  For the "weekly" statistics, they're calculated for all checkins that are seen after 11:59:59PM Sunday night, and for the "monthly" statistics, they're calculated for all checkins that are seen after 11:59:59PM of the last day of the previous month.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.</strong></p>
		<p>A: For now, there's a <a href="http://blog.map256.com/">blog</a> available for news and information.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: Who wrote this abomination anyways?</strong></p>
		<p>A: That would be me, Eric Sigler.  You can stalk me on <a href="http://twitter.com/esigler">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.map256.com/t/esigler">map256</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Q: I have a question not answered on this list, who do I talk to?</strong></p>
		<p>A: Sending an email to <a href="mailto:service@map256.com">service@map256.com</a> </p>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		  var _gaq = _gaq || [];
		  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-1636496-2']);
